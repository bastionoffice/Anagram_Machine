# Xavier's Anagram Solver
Probably the fastest anagram solver on the planet. It's written in PHP and uses a MySQL database to store dictionaries.

## Installation
It's fairly simple to setup.

1. Upload the contents of the folder src/ to your webserver
2. Create a new MySQL database
3. Import the dbStructure.sql file into your database
4. Populate the database with a dictionary. (There is a script in the tools/ folder that can help you with this. English and Dutch dictionaries are also included)
4. Edit the database settings in search.php

## Live demo
The anagram solver is running on my website: [anagram.savjee.be](http://anagram.savjee.be)

## Compression
The CSS and Javascript code in this project are compressed. I'm sorry about that!
